# 🔬 Genielabs — Pioneering AI Animation Research

## We are actively researching AI-driven animation pipelines.

**[Genielabs](https://genielabs.tech)** is at the forefront of AI-powered 2D animation — using machine learning to automate character rigging, motion generation, and asset positioning for game production.

This repository is a direct product of that research: an open-source skill that brings industrial-grade animation automation into Claude.

## What Is This?

**Spine Animation AI** is a [Claude agent skill](SKILL.md) that lets AI handle the tedious parts of Spine 2D animation production:

- **Auto-position** body parts from reference images using SIFT + RANSAC
- **Build skeleton JSON** with proper bone hierarchy and draw order
- **Generate animations** (idle, walk, run, attack, wave, jump) using the 12 principles of animation
- **Produce interactive HTML5 previews** using the official Spine Web Player
- **Correct and refine** existing skeletons with AI-assisted offset adjustments

Think of it as a Spine rigging co-pilot. You provide the art assets; Claude does the math.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Claude Projects (Recommended)

The easiest way — works with any Claude account, no extra software needed.

1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) → create a new **Project**
2. Open **Project Knowledge** → **Add content**
3. Copy the full contents of [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) and paste it in
4. Save — Claude now has the full skill baked in, **including all scripts embedded inline**
5. Upload your character assets and describe what you want:

```
"I have separated body part PNGs for my character.
 Create idle and walk animations."
```

Claude will write the scripts to disk, run the pipeline, and deliver `skeleton.json` + `preview.html`.

> **Why it works:** `SKILL.md` is auto-generated with all 4 Python scripts embedded inside it — Claude extracts and runs them without needing to clone the repo.

---

### Option B: Claude Custom Skill (`/mnt/skills/` environments)

For Claude environments that support mounted skill directories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GenielabsOpenSource/spine-animation-ai.git /mnt/skills/user/spine-animation
```

Claude will automatically discover and load the skill on next session start.

---

### Option C: Manual Pipeline (no Claude needed)

**Step 0: Split a Full Character Into Parts (New!)**

If you only have a single character image (not separated body parts), `split_character.py`
uses Google Gemini to generate a deconstructed sprite atlas and then segments it into
individual transparent PNGs via OpenCV connected-components analysis.

Prerequisites:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable — get a free key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- `pip install google-generativeai`

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key python3 scripts/split_character.py character.png \
  --output-dir parts/
```

Skip this step if you already have separated body-part PNGs.

**1. Auto-position parts from a reference image**

```bash
python3 scripts/position_parts.py \
  --reference assembled_character.png \
  --parts parts/ \
  --output layout.json \
  --debug debug/
```

**2. Build the Spine JSON**

```bash
python3 scripts/build_spine_json.py \
  --config layout.json \
  --output skeleton.json
```

**3. Pack a texture atlas**

```bash
python3 scripts/make_atlas.py \
  --parts parts/ \
  --output atlas/ \
  --name skeleton
```

**4. Generate a self-contained HTML preview**

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_spine_player.py \
  --skeleton skeleton.json \
  --atlas skeleton.atlas \
  --atlas-image skeleton.png \
  --output preview.html
```

Open `preview.html` in any browser — no server needed.

## AI Adjustment Format

When Claude analyzes a skeleton and recommends corrections, it outputs adjustments in this format:

```json
{
  "adjustments": {
    "right-arm": {
      "original_offset": { "x": -1.5, "y": 0 },
      "user_offset":     { "dx": -29.4, "dy": -84.1, "drot": 0 },
      "final_offset":    { "x": -30.9, "y": -84.1 }
    },
    "head": {
      "original_offset": { "x": 3, "y": 20.5 },
      "user_offset":     { "dx": -18.3, "dy": -2, "drot": 0 },
      "final_offset":    { "x": -15.3, "y": 18.5 }
    }
  },
  "draw_order": [
    "right-arm", "left-leg", "right-thigh", "right-leg",
    "left-thigh", "waist", "left-hand", "torso", "hat", "head"
  ]
}
```

Each entry tracks the original offset, the AI-suggested correction delta, and the applied final value.
This makes adjustments **reviewable, revertible, and composable**.

See [docs/adjustment-format.md](docs/adjustment-format.md) for full specification.

## Included Example: Sombrero Character

The `examples/sombrero/` directory contains a complete, working example:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sombrero.json` | Full Spine skeleton with idle animation |
| `sombrero.atlas` | Texture atlas metadata |
| `sombrero.png` | Packed atlas spritesheet (10 parts) |
| `skeleton.json` | Skeleton-only version (no animation) |

The sombrero character has **10 body parts**, **16 bones**, and a 2-second idle loop with:
- Hip breathing bob
- Torso sway
- Head gentle rotation
- Hat follow-through
- Arm natural drift

Open [`demo/sombrero_idle.html`](demo/sombrero_idle.html) to see it in action.
Open [`demo/sombrero_editor.html`](demo/sombrero_editor.html) to interactively adjust part positions and export layout JSON.

## How the Auto-Positioning Works

The `position_parts.py` script uses a two-phase algorithm:

### Phase 1: SIFT + RANSAC (primary)

1. Extract **SIFT keypoints** from each body part (alpha-masked to visible pixels)
2. Extract keypoints from the **assembled reference image**
3. Match with **FLANN** matcher + Lowe's ratio test
4. Estimate a **similarity transform** (translate + scale + rotate) via RANSAC
5. Accept if 4+ inlier matches are found; fall back otherwise

This is more robust than full homography for stylized game art with sparse features.

### Phase 2: Z-Order via Occlusion Analysis

For every overlapping pair of positioned parts:
1. Sample pixels in the overlap region
2. Compare each pixel to the reference image
3. The part whose color is closer to the reference is "on top"
4. Build a directed occlusion graph → topological sort → draw order

### Fallback: Template Matching

Parts too small for SIFT (accessories, tiny objects) fall back to
alpha-masked `TM_CCORR_NORMED` at multiple scales with background penalty scoring.

## Claude Prompting Tips

The best prompts for this skill are specific about assets and intent:

✅ **Good:**
```
"I have separated body part PNGs for a robot character (head.png, torso.png,
 left-arm.png, right-arm.png, left-leg.png, right-leg.png) and a reference
 image showing the assembled character. Create idle and walk animations."
```

✅ **Also good:**
```
"Here's my Spine JSON. The right arm is positioned wrong — it should be
 lower and more to the left. Also add a wave animation."
```

❌ **Too vague:**
```
"Animate this character"
```

See [docs/claude-prompting-guide.md](docs/claude-prompting-guide.md) for more examples.

## Animation Presets

| Preset | Duration | Technique |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| `idle` | 2.0s loop | Overlapping sine waves on hip/torso/head |
| `walk` | 0.8s loop | Opposing arm-leg swing with hip bob |
| `run` | 0.5s loop | Exaggerated walk + forward lean + bounce |
| `wave` | 1.2s | Raise arm, oscillate forearm |
| `jump` | 1.0s | Anticipation squat → launch → land |
| `attack` | 0.6s | Windup → strike → follow-through |

All presets use **bezier easing** (`[0.25, 0, 0.75, 1]`) following the
[12 principles of animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation).

---

## How SKILL.md Stays in Sync

`SKILL.md` is **auto-generated** — don't edit it directly. Instead:

1. Edit `SKILL.template.md` (the prose and instructions)
2. Edit scripts in `scripts/` (the actual code)
3. Push to `main` — GitHub Actions runs `build_skill.py` which:
   - Reads `SKILL.template.md`
   - Finds all `<!-- EMBED:scripts/filename.py -->` markers
   - Injects the actual script contents into collapsible `<details>` blocks
   - Commits the updated `SKILL.md` automatically

This means `SKILL.md` is always a **self-contained document** — when someone pastes it into Claude Projects, Claude has the actual script code right there, no cloning needed.

To build locally:
```bash
python build_skill.py
```
